# KG Tech Test

## Goals

Shuffle the cards - We would like to take the deck that is in sequence and shuffle it so that no two cards are still in sequence.

Deal the cards - We would then like to deal seven cards to each player (one card to the each player, then a second card to each player, and so on)
